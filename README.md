# WeatherApplication-Java-APICalling

This mobile weather application uses the OpenWeatherMap API. The application consists of three screens: Cities List Screen, Current Weather Screen, and Weather Forecast Screen. To access the weather data, an API key needs to be obtained by creating an account on the OpenWeatherMap website. The Cities List Screen uses the provided data to display a list of cities and country codes, and clicking on a city item will take the user to the Current Weather Screen. The Current Weather Screen retrieves the current weather information using the Current Weather API and displays it along with the weather icon based on the documentation provided. Clicking on the "Forecast" button takes the user to the Weather Forecast Screen, which retrieves weather forecast data for the selected city using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API and displays it in a list view along with the weather icon using the Picasso library.
